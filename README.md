# PIC16B-Project

This project will create a face detection algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network, which addresses the task of classifying faces from images. In this project, we will acquire and preprocess the face images, design a CNN model to perform face detection, use evaluation metrics for model assessment, tune models and hyperparameters, and potentially apply more advanced models for better results.
